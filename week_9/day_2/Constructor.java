    Imagine buying a new car. When you receive the car from the dealership, it's not just a bunch of parts;
    it's an assembled vehicle, ready to drive. Certain things are already set for you: the car color,
    the initial odometer reading (usually at 0), a full fuel tank, etc. You don't get the car and then
    have to assemble the pieces together or paint it yourself; the dealership provides it in
    a 'ready-to-use' state. In this analogy, the process that sets up the car in its
    initial state is akin to a constructor in programming.

    Constructor - Programming Explanation:

    In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of method in a class that gets
    automatically called when an object of that class is created. It's usually used to initialize the object.

    The main characteristics of constructors are:

    1. Name Matching: The name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class.
    2. No Return Type: Constructors don't have a return type, not even void.
    3. Initialization: Constructors are primarily used to initialize the instance variables of an object.
    4. Automatic Call: Whenever an object is created, the constructor is automatically called.

    Constructor Design:

    Default Constructor: If you don't provide any constructor in your class, the compiler will
    create a default constructor for you, which won't do anything but will allow the creation of objects.

    Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that accepts parameters allows you to initialize an
    object with specific values at the time of its creation.

    Overloading: You can have multiple constructors in a class, as long as they have different parameter
    lists. This is called constructor overloading.

    Chaining: Within a class, you can call one constructor from another using the this keyword.

    Private Constructor: If you make a constructor private, it prevents the direct instantiation of the
    object from outside the class. This is a key concept in design patterns like Singleton.
