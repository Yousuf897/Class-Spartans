    * Real-Life Analogy:

    String - split():

    Imagine you have a string of Christmas lights with different colored bulbs: red, green, blue, and yellow.
*   Each bulb is separated by a special connector. When you want to rearrange the lights,
*   you disconnect the string at these connectors, and you're left with individual bulbs.
*   Using the split() method on a string with a specific delimiter is like disconnecting the
*   Christmas light string at the connectors, leaving you with segments (or substrings) based
*   on where those connectors (delimiters) were located.
