    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects,"
    which contain data and code: data in the form of fields, often known as attributes or variables;
    and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

    In Java, OOP concepts are the essence of it as Java is inherently object-oriented.
    The aim is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no
     other part of the code can access this data except that function.

    Four Pillars of OOP:

    1. Encapsulation:

    Definition: Encapsulation is bundling the data into a single unit. Encapsulation is the technique
    of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods.
    It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data safe from external modification.

    2. Inheritance:

    Definition: Inheritance allows a class (Child) to use the fields and methods of another class (Parent). This promotes
    code reusability.

    3. Polymorphism:

    Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. It supports
    method overriding and overloading.

    4. Abstraction:

    Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It involves
    creating abstract classes that cannot be instantiated but can be used by other classes.
