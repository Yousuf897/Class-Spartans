    *   A: Primitive Data Types
    *
    *       1. byte  --> number
    *       2. short --> number
    *       3. int --> number
    *       4. long --> number
    *       5. float --> number (decimal values)
    *       6. double --> number (decimal values)
    *       7. char --> characters
    *       8. boolean  --> true, false
    *
    *
* Byte: Like a tiny jar, it holds small integer values ranging from -128 to 127.
byte smallNumber = 100;

Short: A slightly bigger jar that holds a wider range of integers (-32,768 to 32,767).
short mediumNumber = 30000;

int: The most commonly used jar for integers, with a range from -2^31 to (2^31 - 1).
int age = 30;

Long: A big jar for really large integers.
long bigNumber = 3000000000L;

Float: A bottle for floating-point (decimal) numbers, with 6-7 decimal places of precision. Float literals need an 'F' at the end.
float height = 5.9F;

Double: Like a bigger bottle for floating-point numbers, with up to 15 decimal places of precision.
double pi = 3.141592653589793;

Char: A tiny box for a single character.
char initial = 'A';

Boolean: A toggle switch that can be either true or false.
boolean isActive = true;

Non-Primitive Data Types

These are more complex containers that can hold multiple values or a mix of different types.
* The main non-primitive types are:

String: Like a text box, holds a sequence of characters.
String name = "Alice";

Arrays: Like a tray with multiple slots, an array can hold multiple values of the same type.
int[] scores = {90, 85, 77};

Classes and Objects: Think of these as customizable containers that can hold both variables and
* methods.

Interfaces: These are like templates for classes, specifying what methods a class must have.


Understanding data types is crucial because it helps you choose the right type of "container"
* for your data, making your code both efficient and functional. Just like you wouldn't
* store milk in a basket or apples in a bottle, you want to make sure you're using the appropriate
*  data type for each piece of information in your Java programs.
