    *     What is IDE?
          Imagine you're an artist. You could technically paint on any surface
        *  using any kind of brush or even your fingers, but having a proper
        * canvas, easel, and a set of brushes makes the job a
        * whole lot easier and more organized. Similarly,
        * when you're writing Java code (or code in other languages),
        * you could use a basic text editor,
        * but an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse,
        * intelliJ offers a much more powerful and convenient workspace.
