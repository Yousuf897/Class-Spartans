    /*

   welcome to the world of programming and Java! Imagine you want to build a toy car.
   You'd need some materials like plastic, metal, and rubber wheels, right?
   But you'd also need a set of instructions to know how to put these materials
   together to make a working toy car.

    In the digital world, Java is like a set of instructions (or a "recipe")
    for building different kinds of software. Just like the toy car needs materials
    and instructions, software needs code to tell a computer what to do. Java is one
     of many programming languages you can use to write this code.

    Java is especially popular for building big, complex systems like online banking software,
    Android apps, and even websites. It's like a versatile tool in your toolbox
    that you can use to build all kinds of different things.

     In a nutshell, Java is a programming language that you can use to tell a computer how
     to perform tasks. It's like teaching the computer a new language so that you can
     instruct it to do what you want, whether that's running a website, operating an ATM,
     or even controlling a space rove
