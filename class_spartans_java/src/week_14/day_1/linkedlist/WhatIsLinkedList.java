    *
    * LinkedList is a part of Java's collection framework (java.util package) and represents a doubly-linked list. In a linked list, each element (known as a node)
    * contains two pieces of information: the data and a reference to the next
     (and in the case of a doubly-linked list, the previous) node in the sequence.

    Here are some key characteristics and features of LinkedList in Java:

    Node-Based Structure: Unlike arrays or ArrayList, which use a contiguous block of memory, a LinkedList
    is composed of individual nodes. Each node contains the

    * data and references to the next and previous nodes.

    Doubly-Linked: Java's LinkedList is a doubly-linked list, which means that each node has a reference
    to both its next node and its previous node.

    * This allows for bidirectional traversal.


    Dynamic Size: LinkedList can grow or shrink in size dynamically as elements are added or removed.
