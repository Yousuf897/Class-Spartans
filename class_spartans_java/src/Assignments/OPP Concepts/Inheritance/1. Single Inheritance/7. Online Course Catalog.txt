Project: Online Course Catalog

Objective: Use single inheritance to extend a class with educational context.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Course.
    2. Define private member variables: courseName (type String) and courseCode (type String).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getCourseName() and getCourseCode() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called OnlineCourse that extends Course.
    6. Add a private member variable: platform (type String).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getPlatform() to access the platform.
    9. In a main method, create an OnlineCourse object and display all the details.
