Project: Retail Product Management

Objective: Demonstrate single inheritance in a retail context.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Product.
    2. Define private member variables: productName (type String) and price (type double).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getProductName() and getPrice() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called Electronics that extends Product.
    6. Add a private member variable: warrantyPeriod (type int).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getWarrantyPeriod() to access the warranty period.
    9. In a main method, create an Electronics object and display all the details.
