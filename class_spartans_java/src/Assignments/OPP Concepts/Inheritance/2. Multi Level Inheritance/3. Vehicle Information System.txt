Project 3: Vehicle Information System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Vehicle.
        Define private member variables: make (type String), model (type String), and year (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getMake(), getModel(), and getYear() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Car that extends Vehicle.
        Add a private member variable: numberOfDoors (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getNumberOfDoors() to access the number of doors.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called ElectricCar that extends Car.
        Add a private member variable: batteryCapacity (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getBatteryCapacity() to access the battery capacity.

    Method Implementation:
        In the ElectricCar class, override the getModel() method to include battery capacity in the model description.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create an ElectricCar object and display all its details, including those from the Vehicle and Car classes, and the updated model details.
