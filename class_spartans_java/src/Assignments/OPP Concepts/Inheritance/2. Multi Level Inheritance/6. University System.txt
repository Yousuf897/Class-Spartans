Project 6: University System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called UniversityMember.
        Define private member variables: name (type String) and memberId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName() and getMemberId() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Faculty that extends UniversityMember.
        Add a private member variable: department (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getDepartment() to access the department.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Professor that extends Faculty.
        Add a private member variable: rank (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getRank() to access the rank.

    Method Implementation:
        In the Professor class, override the getDepartment() method to include the rank in the department description.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create a Professor object and display all its details, including those from the UniversityMember and Faculty classes, and the updated department details.
