public class Inheritance {

    /*   Real-life Analogy:

    Think of inheritance in terms of biological families. Children inherit traits and characteristics
    from their parents. For instance, you might have your mother's eyes and your father's nose.
    Similarly, a kitten might inherit its fur color from its parents. This passing down of
    attributes is a form of inheritance in the real world.

    Programming Explanation:

    In programming, especially in object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism where a new class
    inherits properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class.
    This provides an opportunity to promote code reuse and establish a relationship between
    the parent (superclass) and child (subclass) classes.

    Using inheritance, the child class not only inherits the members of the parent class but can also have
    additional members (attributes and methods). The primary advantage
    is that it allows developers to create a new class based on an existing class without rewriting the
    same code.

    In Java, the extends keyword is used to denote inheritance from a superclass.

    Types of Inheritance:

    There are different types of inheritance, depending on the number of superclasses and subclasses:

    1. Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.

    2. Multiple Inheritance (Interface): A class inherits from more than one class. Java does not
    support multiple inheritances with classes. However, multiple inheritance in Java is achieved
    through interfaces.

    3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a subclass, making it a multilevel inheritance chain.
     For example, if Class C inherits from Class B, which in turn inherits from Class A, it's a multilevel inheritance.

    4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single class.

    5. Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance. It's not supported in Java
    through class-based inheritance (due to the "diamond problem"), but it can be mimicked using interfaces.
