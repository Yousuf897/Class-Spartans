        Real-life analogy:

        Imagine you're looking at two boxes of crayons. One box has 5 crayons, and the other has 8 crayons.
        You decide that you'll choose the box that has more crayons.

        Java-related explanation:

        The conditional (ternary) operator is like making a quick choice between two options.

        It follows this format:

        condition ? option1 : option2;

        If the condition is true, you pick option1. If it's false, you pick option2.

        For our crayon example:

        int box1 = 5; // crayons in box 1
        int box2 = 8; // crayons in box 2

        int chosenBox = (box1 > box2) ? box1 : box2;

        System.out.println("I chose the box with " + chosenBox + " crayons.");
*/
