    Variable Types (Data Types)

    Just like you wouldn't put liquids in a cardboard box, each variable in Java has a specific "type" that
    tells us what kind of data it can hold. The primary types include:

    1. int for integers: int age = 25;
    2. double for floating-point numbers: double height = 5.9;
    3. char for single characters: char grade = 'A';
    4. boolean for true/false values: boolean isOnline = true;
    5. String for text (note that String is actually a class, not a primitive type, but it's often
    lumped in with these for simplicity): String name = "Alice";
