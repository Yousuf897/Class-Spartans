     *
     * An Exception is a problem that can occur during the normal flow of an execution.
     * A method can throw an exception when something wails at runtime.
     * If that exception couldn’t be handled, then the execution gets terminated before
     *  it completes the task. If we handled the exception, then the normal flow gets continued.
     *  Exceptions are a subclass of java.lang.Exception.
