    * A class which contains abstract keyword in its declaration then it is an Abstract Class.
    *
    * Points to remember:

    • Abstract classes may or may not include abstract methods

    • If a class is declared abstract then it cannot be instantiated.

    • If a class has abstract method then we have to declare the class as abstract class

    • When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for
    * all of the abstract methods in its parent class.

    However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
