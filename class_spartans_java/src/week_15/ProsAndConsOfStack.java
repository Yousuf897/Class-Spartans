    * Pros of Using a Stack:

    LIFO Behavior: Stacks are suitable for modeling scenarios where the order of processing or access
    *  should follow the Last-In-First-Out behavior.

    Simple Implementation: Stacks are relatively easy to implement and understand, making them useful
    * for a wide range of applications.

    Efficient for Certain Operations: Pushing and popping elements onto/from a stack are very efficient
    *  operations with a constant time complexity.

    Cons of Using a Stack:

    Limited Usage: Stacks are not well-suited for all types of data access patterns. They are primarily
    *  used in specific scenarios where LIFO behavior is required.

    No Random Access: Unlike arrays or lists, stacks don't provide random access to elements. You can
    * only access the top element.

    Potential Stack Overflow: If elements are pushed onto a stack without proper control, it can lead
    *  to a stack overflow error, especially in recursive algorithms.

    In summary, a stack in Java is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle
    *  and is used for specific scenarios where this behavior is required.
*  It is implemented using various classes, and it provides efficient push and pop operations. However,
* it may not be suitable for all data access patterns.
